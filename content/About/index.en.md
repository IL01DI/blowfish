# A loner
There is a saying in English that familial bonds are always stronger than other relationships. That is "blood is thicker than water".

I, however, do not agree with this. There is no way to even trust anyone, not even our family since they cannot provide trustness and love. Even if we agree, our family would and should be extended towards humanity, not solely on a particular group you live. But if we include this perception, by confirming this there is no way to even trust anyone.

Btw, I have very weak family ties.

The truth above all these appearences lies in the lies of tradition.
- Why family is not family
- Friendship as true love
- Why I am a loner?
