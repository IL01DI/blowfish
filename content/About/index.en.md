"This is just one big page where I can write all about myself, without feeling the need for it to be useful." - Derek Sivers (https://sive.rs/about)

## Family, humanity, fraternity
There is a saying in English that familial bonds are always stronger than other relationships. That is "blood is thicker than water".

I, however, do not agree with this. There is no way to even trust anyone, not even our family since they cannot provide trustness and love forever. Even if we agree with this, our family would and should be extended towards humanity, not solely on a particular group you live with. That's why, we are all cousins, even if we are strangers. But if we include this view, by confirming the proverb, there is no way to even trust anyone.

Btw, I have a very weak family ties.

## Friendship as true love
The truth above all these appearences lies in the lies of tradition.

Every human being love to be loved. Whatever love is, it is the true beauty behind all the things we love, it is the only one who loves itself and be loved by itself. It is so perfect that the only thing it can do is to love itself. From love derives everything inside existence, giving all the essence it needs from love, and move alongside to the perfection of love.

As I'm a lover, I cannot love myself to be loved. Even if one that isn't love can love itself, one doesn't feel to be loved. That's one of the many reasons human is a social being, to seek love and achieve a full and deep life with the other.

However, I don't agree the nowadays conception of friendship since  many online platforms, whether is a social network or a multiplayer game, have turned the view of a friend as someone that accepts a request to be a friend (more like a companion or an acquaintance). Hence why it is convenient to ask philosophy if friendship truly is friendship.

Therefore, I should define what is a friend. First of all, if one seeks someone just to be loved by loving that someone, does that make someone a friend? Not necessarily, but, at least to be a friend, that one must also love the one solely to be loved. The end and the aim of love is by itself love.

Since it is necessary to love someone in life, the highest love would always be the one, the dearest of all within one life, the most meaningful within our minds: a childhood friend, a lover.
