> **Note:** It doesn't work on Replit.

> **Requirements:** Hugo (version 0.87.0 or later)

Run 2 or 3 times: npx blowfish-tools

Every time you run it, press 'y'.

Select the first option of the menu.

It will put the files on a folder called 'newSites' (as a default).
- If you run Codespace, you cannot select '.' to the root directory.

Put outside of the folder

If you get an error about not being allowed to deploy to github-pages due to environment protection rules, make sure you remove any existing GitHub pages environments.
