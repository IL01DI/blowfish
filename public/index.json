Sextus Empiricus, Adversus mathematicos, VII, 111. Verses 28 (χρεώ)-32. Simplicius, in Aristotelis de Caelo commentaria, 557. Verses 28 (χρεώ)-30. Diogenes Laertius, Vitae philosophorum, IX, 22 Once the chariot took me along the famous Goddess\u0026rsquo; Way, which leads the wise man through all the cities, it travelled as far as my heart could desire. I was taken down this road while maidens led the way with wise steeds pulling my chariot. The axle, glowing in the socket as it turned with the spinning wheels at either end, sounded like a whistle. As the Daughters of the Sun hurried to bring me into the light, they pulled their veils from their faces and left the realm of Night. Here stand the Gates of Night and Day, with a lintel above and a stone threshold below. Strong doors seal them high above the ground, and Avenging Justice holds the keys to unlock these doors. The maidens pleaded softly and cunningly persuaded her to release the bolted bars of the gates. As the doors swung open, they revealed a wide entrance. The brazen posts, studded with rivets and nails, moved back individually. The maidens then led the horses and the chariot straight through them, and the goddess greeted me kindly, took my right hand in hers, and spoke these words to me:\nWelcome, youth, who comes to my abode on the car that bears you, tended by immortal charioteers! It is no ill chance, but right and justice, that has sent thee forth to travel on this way. Far, indeed, does it lie from the beaten track of men! You must learn all things, including the unwavering heart of true wisdom and the opinions of mortals, which hold no genuine belief. However, it is necessary to learn how to judge things by considering all aspects. However, do you refrain from approaching this line of inquiry merely out of habit? Should your experience lead you to glance or listen with curiosity, approach it instead with reason and evaluate the debated evidence I present. There is only one way left to discuss…\nFragment 2 # Verses 1-6, 7-8. Proclus, in Platonis Timaeum commentaria, I, 345. Verses 3-8. Simplicius, in Aristotelis Physica commentaria, 116. Verse 4 (πειθοῦς ἐστι κέλευθος). Proclus, in Platonis Parmenidem commentarius, 1078. Verse 5 (καὶ ὡς \u0026hellip;). Proclus, in Platonis Parmenidem commentarius, 1078. Verse 6. Proclus, in Platonis Parmenidem commentarius, 1078. Keep your eyes focused on objects, even if they are far away, even though they are directly in front of you. You cannot stop the existing thing from clinging to itself, systematically dispersing, or uniting.\nFragment 3 # Clemens Alexandrinus, Stromateis VI, 23. Plotinus, Enneades, V, 1, 8. Plotinus, Enneades, V, 9, 5. Proclus, in Platonis Parmenidem commentarius, 1152. Proclus, Theologia Platonica, I, 14. … It is all one to me where I begin, for I shall return there again.\nFragment 4 # Verses 1-4. Clemens Alexandrinus, Stromata V, 2, 15. Verse 1. Proclus, in Platonis Parmenidem commentarius, 1152. Verse 1. Theodoretus, Graecarum affectionum curatio, I, 72. Verse 2. Damascius, De principiis, I, 67. Come now, I will tell you —and do you hearken to my saying and carry it away— the only two ways of search that can be thought of. The first, namely, that it is, and that it is impossible for not to be, is the way of belief, for truth is its companion. The other, namely, that it is not, and that it must needs not be, —that, I tell you, is a path that none can learn of at all. For you could not know what is not —that is impossible— nor utter it.\nFragment 5 # Proclus, in Platonis Parmenidem commentaria, 708. For it is the same thing that can be thought and that can be.\nFragment 6 # Verses 1-9 (ἔστι \u0026hellip;). Simplicius, in Aristotelis physicorum libros commentaria, 117. Verses 1-2 (… ἔστιν). Simplicius, in Aristotelis physicorum libros commentaria, 86. Verses 8-9 (… ταὐτόν). Simplicius, in Aristotelis physicorum libros commentaria, 7. It must be that what can be spoken and thought is, for it can be, and it is not possible for what is nothing to be. This is what I bid you ponder. I hold you back from this first way of inquiry, and from this other also, upon which mortals knowing nought wander two-faced; for helplessness guides the wandering thought in their breasts so that they are born along stupefied like men deaf and blind. Undiscerning crowds, who hold that it is and is not the same and not the same, and all things travel in opposite directions!\nFragment 7 # Verses 1. Aristotle, Metaphysica, Ν 2, 1089a. Verses 1-2: Plato, Sophista, 237a y 258d. Verses 1-2. Simplicius, in Aristotelis physicorum libros commentaria, 143-144. Verse 2. Simplicius, in Aristotelis physicorum libros commentaria, 78 y 650. Verses 2-6. Sextus Empiricus, Adversus mathematicos, VII, 111. Verses 3-5. Diogenes Laertius, Vitae philosophorum, IX, 22. Verses 3-6. Sextus Empiricus, Adversus mathematicos, VII, 114. For this shall never be proved, that the things that are not are; and do you restrain your thought from this way of inquiry.\nFragment 8 # Verses 1-52. Simplicius, in Aristotelis physicorum libros commentaria, 145-146. Verses 50-61. Simplicius, in Aristotelis physicorum libros commentaria, 38-39. Verse 4. Plutarchus, Adversus Colotem, 1114c. Verse 4. Proclus. In Platonis Parmenidem commentaria, 1152 y 1077 y 1084. Verses 36 (οὐδὲν \u0026hellip;)-38. Simplicius, in Aristotelis physicorum libros commentaria, 86-87. Only one path is left for us to speak of, namely, that It is. In this path are very many tokens that being, or what is, is uncreated and indestructible; for it is complete, immovable, and without end. Nor was it ever, nor will it be; for now it is, all at once, a continuous one. For what kind of origin for it wilt thou look for? In what way and from what source could it have drawn its increase? I shall not let thee say nor think that it came from what is not; for it can neither be thought nor uttered that anything is not. And, if it came from nothing, what need could have made it arise later rather than sooner? Therefore, it must either be altogether or not at all. Nor will the force of truth suffer aught to arise besides itself from that which is not. Wherefore, justice doth not lose her fetters and let anything come into being or pass away but holds it fast. Our judgment thereon depends on this: “Is it or is it not?” Surely it is adjudged, as it requires must be, that we are to set aside the one way as unthinkable and nameless (for it is not a true way) and that the other path is real and true. How, then, can being, or what is, be going to be in the future? Or how could it come into being? If it came into being, it is not; nor is it if it is going to be in the future. Thus is becoming extinguished and passing away, not to be heard of.\nNor is it divisible, since it is all alike, and there is no more of it in one place than in another, to hinder it from holding together, nor less of it, but everything is full of what is. Wherefore it is wholly continuous; for what is, is in contact with what is. Moreover, it is immovable in the bonds of mighty chains, without beginning and end; since coming into being and passing away have been driven afar, and true belief has cast them away. It is the same, and it rests in the self-same place, abiding in itself. Thus, it remained constant in its place; for hard necessity keeps it in the bonds of the limit that holds it fast on every side. Wherefore it is not permitted to what is to be infinite; for it needs nothing; while, if it were infinite, it would need everything.\nThe thing that can be thought and that for the sake of which the thought exists is the same; for you cannot find thought without something that is, as to which it is uttered. And there is not, and never shall be, anything besides what is, since fate has chained it to be whole and immovable. Wherefore all these things are but names which mortals have given, believing them to be true—coming into being and passing away, being and not being, change of place and alteration of bright colour. Since, then, it has the furthest limit, it is complete on every side, like the mass of a rounded sphere, equally poised from the centre in every direction; for it cannot be greater or smaller in one place than in another. For there is no nothing that could keep it from reaching out equally, nor can aught being, or what is, be more here and less there than what is, since it is all inviolable. For the point from which it is equal in every direction tends equally to the limits. Here shall I close my trustworthy speech and thought about the truth. Henceforward learn the beliefs of mortals, giving ear to the deceptive ordering of my words. Mortals have made up their minds to name two forms, one of which they should not name, and that is where they go astray from the truth. They have distinguished them as opposite in form, and have assigned to them marks distinct from one another. To the one they allot the fire of heaven, gentle, very light, in every direction the same as itself, but not the same as the other. The other is just the opposite of it, night dark, a compact and heavy body. Of these I tell thee the whole arrangement as it seems likely; for so no thought of mortals will ever outstrip thee.\nFragment 9 # Simplicius, in Aristotelis physicorum libros commentaria, 180. Now that all things have been named light and night, and the names which belong to the power of each have been assigned to these things and those, everything is full at once of light and night dark, both equal, since neither has aught to do with the other.\nFragment 10 # Clemens Alexandrinus, Stromateis V, 138. And thou shalt know the substance of the sky, and all the signs in the sky, and the resplendent works of the glowing sun\u0026rsquo;s pure torch, and whence they arose. And thou shalt learn likewise of the wandering deeds of the round-faced moon and her substance. Thou shalt know, too, the heavens that surround us, whence they arose, and how Necessity took them and bound them to keep the limits of the stars…\nFragment 11 # Simplicius, in Aristotelis de caelo commentaria, 559. … How the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the sky that is common to all, and the Milky Way, and the outermost Olympus, and the burning might of the stars arose.\nFragment 12 # Verses 1-3. Simplicius, in Aristotelis physicorum libros commentaria, 39. Verses 2-6. Simplicius, in Aristotelis physicorum libros commentaria, 31. The narrower bands were filled with unmixed fire, and those next them with night, and in the midst of these rushes their portion of the fire. In the midst of these is the divinity that directs the course of all things; for she is the beginner of all painful birth and all begetting, driving the female to the embrace of the male, and the male to that of the female.\nFragment 13 # Plato, Symposium, 178 b. Aristotle, Metaphysica, Α 4, 984b. Plutarchus, Amatorius, 13, 756f. Simplicius, in Aristotelis physicorum libros commentaria, 39. First of all the gods, she contrived Eros.\nFragment 14 # Plutarchus, Adversus Colotem, 15, 1116a. Shining by night with borrowed light, wandering around the earth.\nFragment 15 # Plutarchus, De facie in orbe lunae, 16, 929b. Plutarchus, Quaestiones Romanae, 76, 282b. Always looking to the beams of the sun.\nFragment 16 # Aristotle, Metaphysica, Γ 5, 1009b. Theophrastus, De sensu, 3 (H. Diels, Doxographi Graeci, 1879, pag. 499). For just as thought stands at any time to the mixture of its erring organs, so does it come to men; for that which thinks is the same, namely, the substance of the limbs, in every man; for their thought is that of which there is more in them.\nFragment 17 # Galenus, in Hippocratis Epidemiorum librum VI commentaria, II, 46 (Corpus Medicorum Graecorum/Latinorum V 10, 2, 2, p. 119). On the right boys; on the left girls.\nFragment 18 # Caelius Aurelianus, Tardae passiones, IV, 9, 134. When a man and a woman mix the seeds of Love, a power formed in the veins from the different bloods produces well-built bodies by preserving the proper proportion. For if, when the seeds are mixed, the strengths are in conflict and do not make a unity in the body formed by the mixture, then cruelly they will afflict the sex of the offspring with double seed.\nFragment 19 # Simplicius, in Aristotelis de caelo commentaria, 558. Thus, according to men\u0026rsquo;s opinions, things come into being, and thus they are now. In time, they will grow up and pass away. To each of these things, men have assigned a fixed name.\n","date":"7 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1733595213695-fragments-of-parmenides/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Fragments of Parmenides","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"7 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/greek/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Greek","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/philosophy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Philosophy","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"7 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/text/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Text","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"23 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/bookmark/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Bookmark","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"23 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/directory/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Directory","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"23 June 2024","externalUrl":"https://raindrop.io/7cr2hwn8g8/in-45352717","permalink":"/projects/1719160356422-in/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"IN","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"23 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/raindrop.io/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Raindrop.io","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 June 2024","externalUrl":"https://il01di.github.io/2048","permalink":"/projects/1717780888238-2048/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"2048","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"7 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/game/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Game","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/conlang/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Conlang","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/language/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Language","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 June 2024","externalUrl":"https://latina-conlang.notion.site/e61618fb59b740ebb76b51734eb4f338?v=41372427d62f4eb3b0e24586967a22ee\u0026pvs=4","permalink":"/projects/1717621534777-latina/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Latina","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"5 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/notion/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Notion","type":"tags"},{"content":"This section contains all my current projects.\n","date":"5 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Projects","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
